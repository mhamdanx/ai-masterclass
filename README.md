# 📚 **AI Masterclass: From Zero to Hero**  

Welcome to the **AI Masterclass** repository! This comprehensive course takes you from a complete beginner in AI to an advanced practitioner capable of working with **state-of-the-art (SOTA) technologies** like **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Autonomous AI Agents**.



## 🧭 **Course Overview**  

The course is structured into four levels:

1. **Foundations of AI (Beginner)**  
   - Learn the basics of AI, Python programming, and essential math for machine learning.  

2. **Core AI Concepts (Intermediate)**  
   - Gain proficiency in machine learning techniques and deep learning fundamentals.  

3. **Advanced AI Techniques (Advanced)**  
   - Explore advanced architectures, generative models, NLP, and reinforcement learning.  

4. **State-of-the-Art AI (Expert)**  
   - Master LLMs, AI agents, multi-modal systems, and deployment strategies.  



## 🛠️ **Tools, Languages, and Frameworks**  

### **Languages:**  
- Python (Primary)  
- Javascript
- Dart

### **Frameworks and Libraries:**  
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc (Data Processing)
